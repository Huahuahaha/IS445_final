Professor Uhe

IS445 -Data Visualization

Final Project

Biggest Takeaway from this class

Since this is my first time accessing data visualization on a Python program, it is a little bit hard for me to figure out lots of graph functions and their packages. The biggest takeaway can be separated into two ways: coding and ideas.
Like I said before, it is my first time writing Python code on data visualization. I learned a lot of ways to drawing graph such as scatter plots, line charts, pie charts, etc. The professor's video demonstration really helped me a lot on both doing homework and final projects. For the ideas, I learned how to use the data to lie and also learned how to make different data visualizations on different perspectives of the audience. I learned how to make a balance between colors and size to make my report more attractive. It provide me the basic line and rules of how to create a excellent data visualization reprot. 

Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacher

Like I said before, it is still a little bit difficult to start programming if u are a "freshman". I face a lot of problems with importing library and packages to draw the graphs. Also I hope the professor can teach more about different kinds of graph drawings. For me, it is quite difficult to draw more complex graphs that may professor excepted. The most important thing is about data cleaning and extracting. Professor didn't teach a lot about this whcih means we can just use the prepared dataset to do the data visualization. We can not handle the raw data. I hope this can be part of the class also.
